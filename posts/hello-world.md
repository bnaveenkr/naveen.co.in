Hello there! I have decided to write things in public domain. This site is built using 

- [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) This seems like an interesting project. I always wanted to give this project a try. Looks like this is good a fit for a static website generator like this one.

- [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) my site has been running using netlify for a couple of years. It was setup when I was learning netlify long time ago and completely forgot about it. This is still running!

- Markdown: All the posts are in markdown!
